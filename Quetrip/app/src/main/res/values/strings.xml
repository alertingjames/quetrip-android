    <string name="drinks_desc">This is another way to start the day in Brazil. Vitamina is a fruit smoothie blended with milk and sugar, and is especially popular on the health scene – although the truly health conscious order it without sugar or add sweetener instead. The two most popular vitaminas are banana with granola, and avocado. In Brazil, avocado is eaten sweet and not as a savory item as in some countries. Be sure to try a avocado vitamina – it will leave you wondering why have you never eaten it sweet before.</string>

    <string name="attractions_desc">Goiás testifies to the occupation and colonization of the lands of central Brazil in the 18th and 19th centuries. The urban layout is an example of the organic development of a mining town, adapted to the conditions of the site. Although modest, both public and private architecture form a harmonious whole, thanks to the coherent use of local materials and vernacular techniques.</string>

    <string name="attractions_comment_desc">The historical center is well preserved and because the old paving, it is naturally difficult to walk around with baby carriage. Do not forget comfortable shoes and if you want to have lunch, the restaurants usually offer food early. If you\'re going to eat after 13:30, that will be difficult to find fresh food.</string>
